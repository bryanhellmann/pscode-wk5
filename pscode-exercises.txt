// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

int number1, number2, 
    
    printf("Enter two integers: ");

    // calculate the sum
    sum = number1 + number2;

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Int num
	Printf(“Enter an integer”)

If(num/2 == 0)
	printf("num is an even number");
   else
      printf("num is an odd number");

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

Read in 5 separate numbers. 

Int num1, num2, num3, num4,num5
	Printf(“Enter 5 unique numbers”)
  
Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Calc Sum1 = (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)
Calc Avg1 = Sum1/5

 
Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
Int num1, num2, num3, num4,num5
	Printf(“Enter 5 unique numbers”)
Calc MinX = MIN(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
Calc MaxX = MAX(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Display Avg1
	printf(“The average of the five numbers inputted is Avg1”)
Display MinX
	printf(“The smallest number is MinX”)
Display MaxX
	printf(“The biggest number is MaxX”)
